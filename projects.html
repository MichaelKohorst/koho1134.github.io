            <br>Last semester in Operating Systems our final project was to create a working OS that would be able act like windows. It would show an icon of the item, the name, the file size and the permissions of the items.
            The icon for the item would depend on the type of the item. For example if it was a png then the icon would be a image icon, if it was a directory like desktop then it would have a directory icon and so on.

            <br>Last semester in Advance Information Security our final project was to create a crypto currency based on bitcoin. It was called Tommy Coin and this coin would have the ability to pay others and mine. To keep track of things a
            chain would be formed. This chain would track payments, payouts and mining. To mine a Tommy Coin the computer would have to solve a puzzle and the reward would be a Tommy Coin.

            <br>In Computer Architecture last year one of our projects was to create an CPU that would be able to pipeline. This means rather than executing one instruction it would have multiple intructions running at once. Each 
            instruction would be at a different stage within the CPU.

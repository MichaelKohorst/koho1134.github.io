Personal Website:

Instructions: To run my website all you have to do is visit https://michaelkohorst.github.io/koho1134.github.io/index.html. The website is hosted by github-pages. 

index.html: Contains the homepage of the site and gives an intro to me
projects.html: Contains an overview of some projects I have worked on over my career.
resume.html: Contains a shorted version of my resume and what I have done.
fun.html: Contains a little bit more about me and what I do for fun. 
foundation2.css: Contains all my css that I created to personalize my webpage. 

js folder: Contains foundation, which I used to template my website and order the structure.
css folder: Contains all of the foundation css.

others: Rest of the content are images that feature in the website, although the ordering of the files of the website are a little out of order as the images should be in their own folder.
